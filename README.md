#### 3. Clone your new repo to your local machine
#### 4. Go to the **NEXT** section

## Starting the Project
1. Create a Firebase project and set up authentication. Use [these videos](https://vimeo.com/showcase/codetracker-firebase) as a refresher if needed.
1. From your command line, be in the root directory and run `npm install` OR `npm i` for short.
1. Next, run `npm run prepare`. This command sets up husky to track eslint errors on commit that will make your deploy fail on Netlify.
1. To start your application, run `npm run dev`. THIS IS THE COMMAND YOU WILL USE TO RUN YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER FROM NOW ON.
1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

### Deploying on Netlify
Netlify will automatically detect your project and prepopulate the settings, but should something go wrong and it does not, here are the commands:

- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `.next`

#### Additional Steps to Take on Netlify
- Add Environmental Variables
    - Any Enviromental variables you are using in your `.env` file should be added to Netlify. 
        - Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment > Environment variables and the keys and values there if you did not add them when you were deploying your site

- Update Firebase URL Settings
    - In Firebase under Authentication select sign in methods, scroll to Authorized domains. Add your Netlify URL.
