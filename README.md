Overview of the project: Limeify is an interactive music storage app that allow users to view playlists that other users have created. It also allows them to view, create, edit, and delete playlists that they've created.

Once they've created the playlist, they can they choose songs from a prepoluated list to add to it.

Description of the user and the problem you are solving for them:

With so many music streaming platforms, people often have playlists scattered across multiple apps, leading to fragmented listening experiences.

There’s a need for a central, personalized space to easily create, manage, and customize playlists.

Our app aims to simplify playlist management, giving users full control over creating, updating, and deleting playlists from a vast library of songs, making their music experience more organized and enjoyable.
